# General Information
## About
Dunia in Kiswahili means - The World. This memory game will be based on the world map and is inspired by my love for travel.

The game is based on matching flags of european countries. 
## How to Play
* To play, simply click on a card to reveal the flag and find a match. Once the user matches 2 identical flags, 1 point is scored. 
* To win the game, simple match all 12 flags.
* To play again, click on the Restart Game button and the card deck will be shuffled.

## Design 
The webiste's design and layout is based on fonts, colors, wireframes, images and icons.

### Fonts

### Wireframes
* Wireframes were created using the [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) software.

* A pdf of the wireframes can be found [here](/Assets/Wireframes/Dunia-Memory-Game.pdf). This file can also be downloaded from Github. (**Please Note:** _[Adobe Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) is required to view files in pdf format_).
